A simple cross platform ToDo list mobile application developed in JavaScript using React-Native

If you would like to use the application follow this [link](https://expo.dev/@zaaminrattansi/ToDoList). 
Unfortunately, expo only supports sharing applications on android devices right now :(

But, if you are on an iphone and want to view the application email me at zaamin.rattansi@mail.utoronto.ca to be added to the expo project team where you'll gain access to the app.
